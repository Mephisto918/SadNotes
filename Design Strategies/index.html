            <h3>Top-Down Strategy</h3>
            <p>The <span>top-down strategy</span> uses the modular approach to develop the design of a system. It is called so because it starts from the <span>top</span> or <span>heighes-level module</span> and moves towards the <span>lowest-level module</span> </p>

            <h3>Bottom-up Strategy</h3>
            <p><span>Bottom-Up Strategy</span> follows the modular approach to develop the design of the system. It is called so because it starts from the <span>bottom</span> or <span>the most basic level modules</span> and moves towards the <span>heighest level modules</span></p>
            <ol>
                <li>The modules at the most basic or the lowest level are identified</li>
                <li>These modules are then grouped together based on the function performed by each module to form next <span>heigher-level modules</span></li>
                <li>Then, these modules are further combined to form the next <span>higher-level modules</span></li>
                <li>This process of grouping several simpler modules to form higher level modules continues until the main module of system development process is achieved</li>

            <h3>Structured Design</h3>
            <p>Structured design is a <span>data-flow based</span> methodology that helps in identifyinh the input and ouput of the developing system. The main objective of strucured design is to minimize the complexity and increase the modularity of a program. Structured design also helps in describing the functional aspect of the system</p>
            <p>In structured designing, the system specification acts as a basis for pgraphical representig the flow of data and sequcne of process involved in a software development with the help of <span>DFDs</span>. After developing the DFDs for the software system, the next step is to develop the structure char</p>
