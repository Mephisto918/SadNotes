            <h1>What is Structured Analysis</h1>
            <p>Structured Analysis is a development method that allows the analyst to understand to understand the system and its activities in a logical way</p>
            <p>It is a systematic approach, which uses <span>graphical cons</span> that analyze and refine the objectives of an existing system and develop a new system specification which can be easily understandable by user</p>

                <h2>ATTRIBUTES OF STRUCTURED ANALYSIS</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is graphical which specifies the presentaion of application</li>
                    <li>It divides the processes so that it gives a clear picture of system flow</li>
                    <li><span>It is logical rather than pysical</span> i.e, the elements of system do not depend on vendor or hardware</li>
                    <li><span>It is a approach that works from high-level overviews to lower-level details</span></li>

                    <p>It is a technique developed by <span>Larry Constantine</span> to express the requirements of system in a graphical form</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It shows the flow of data between various functions of system and specifies how the current systems is implemented</li>
                        <li>It is an initial stage of design phase that functionally divides the requirement specifications down to the lowest level of detail</li>
                        <li>Its graphical nature makes it a good communication tool between user and analyst or analyst and system designer</li>
                        <li><span>It gives an overview of what data a system processes, what transformation are performed, what data are being stored, what results are produced and where they flow</span></li>

                    <p>A data dictionary <span>improves the communication between the analys and the user</span>. <span>It plays an important role in building databse.</span> Most DBMSs have a data dictionary as a standard feature</p>
